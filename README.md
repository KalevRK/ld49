Theme: "Unstable"

## Brainstorming
Restaurant idea
* Moving around, spinning around, out of control.  Constantly out of control, need to not knock into things.
* Stack of things and you need to walk to keep in balance.
* Restaurant
* Pick up dishes and walk to tables
* Stack multiple dishes and not be in balance
* Each dish had a time on it and you get points depending on how fast you get it
* But you have to stack things in your hand and it can topple
* If you walk into a table or drop the stack game over

Platforms with things dropping on them and you have to move them to balance the platform

Racing game with cliff, have to do switchbacks while heavily loaded.  Bring water to village.

Fluid dynamics

Themes:
* 80s, synth - fast delivery driver
* Rural town - kind of silly

Gameplay:
* Top down, move with keyboard
* Stack items on top of character, items respond to physics.
* Navigation on some kind of gameplay mesh.
